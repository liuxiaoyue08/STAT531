</head><body><h1>About data formats</h1>



All data are in space-separated ASCII format.

Most of the data sets in this collection are numbers of case reports
tabulated for a specific region (borough/city/county/region) over
a specified period of time.
Various date formats are used, noted in the descriptions of files
in a way that should be fairly clear:
<ul>
<li>YYYY Number of digits specifying a year, usually YY (54) or YYYY (1954).
</li><li>MM   Month
</li><li>DD   Day:  DDD signifies Julian day (1..366), DD usually means day of month.
</li><li>FFF  Number of digits specifying a fraction of a year.
</li></ul>
<p>
<emph>Missing data</emph> are usually specified with a *.
</p><p>
Some files have headers<emph>, denoted with a # at the
beginning of the lines, to specify the meaning of each column.
